ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Jaime Roque, a Network Technician at Dreyfous with a growing specialization in Cybersecurity and SOC operations. Iâ€™m actively developing my skills as a Security Analyst by working through real-world detection and response scenarios on the CyberRange platform. My focus is on threat analysis, log correlation, incident response, and security automation. Here you'll find practical projects and scripts that reflect my journey into Blue Team operations and hands-on defense strategies.
