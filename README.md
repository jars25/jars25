# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshmadakor/">Jaime A.Roque Soulette</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio 

👋 Hi! I'm Jaime Roque Soulette — a bilingual IT and Cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in networking, field support, and systems administration, now transitioning into Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC).  
I hold a Master’s in Cybersecurity Management from Nova Southeastern University, where I led a HIPAA-aligned security compliance project focused on policy development, risk mitigation, and business continuity for small medical environments.  
My technical foundation in network infrastructure and IT operations gives me the ability to bridge the gap between technical controls and organizational governance. 
Here you’ll find a portfolio of projects demonstrating my hybrid skill set across **technical security operations**, **vulnerability management**, and **GRC consulting**.


##  Vulnerability Management Projects

- **[Vulnerability Management Program Implementation](https://github.com/jars25/vmp/tree/main)**

## 🏥 Cybersecurity Compliance & GRC Projects

- **[Implementing Information Security Policies and HIPAA Compliance at a Small Medical Clinic](https://github.com/jars25/NSU-Cybersecurity-HIPAA-Compliance-Project/tree/main)**  
  Graduate capstone project focused on aligning a small medical clinic’s information security posture with HIPAA, NIST CSF, and ISO 27001 standards.  
  Includes executive report, risk assessment, business continuity plan, and security policy documentation.
